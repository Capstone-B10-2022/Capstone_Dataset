# Python3 program to implement insert
# operation in an sorted array.

# Inserts a key in arr[] of given capacity.
# n is current size of arr[]. This function
# returns n+1 if insertion is successful, else n.
def insertSorted(arr, n, key, capacity):
	
	# Cannot insert more elements if n is
	# already more than or equal to capacity
	if (n >= capacity):
		return n

	i = n - 1
	while i >= 0 and arr[i] > key:
		arr[i + 1] = arr[i]
		i -= 1

	arr[i + 1] = key

	return (n + 1)

# Driver Code
arr = [12, 16, 20, 40, 50, 70]

for i in range(20):
	arr.append(0)

capacity = len(arr)
n = 6
key = 26

print("Before Insertion: ", end = " ");
for i in range(n):
	print(arr[i], end = " ")
	
# Inserting key
n = insertSorted(arr, n, key, capacity)

print("\nAfter Insertion: ", end = "")
for i in range(n):
	print(arr[i], end = " ")
